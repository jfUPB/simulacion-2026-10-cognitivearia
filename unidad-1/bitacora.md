#Generative art concepts video: The roots.
"The imagined machine produces the work", it refers o when theres is automization and randomiation in the creation of art. Randomness is a way for the artist to have various possibilities and an array of variation where they can choose from. It has existed for decades, maybe even all the way back to the 50s where people would have art that can be considered generative from a technological perspective abd then even further back when generative art doesnt require coding, but entropy and randonmess. and art made from rthe role of dice for example could be use to interpret it into a physical thing. it has evolved and came up as visual art during the early 20th centurywith conceptual artist like duchamp, who really put the importance of tha artist as secondary, and let room for the randomization or the machine to take an impornat part in the creation process. toilet.
